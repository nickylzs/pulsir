<i>Based on the Automattic DMCA policy. We love you guys &lt;3</i>

<p>If you believe that content available by means of the Website (as defined in our Terms of Service) infringes one or more of your copyrights, please notify us by providing a written notice (“Infringement Notice”) containing the information described below to the designated agent listed below. If Automattic takes action in response to an Infringement Notice, it will make a good faith attempt to contact the party that made such content available by means of the most recent email address, if any, provided by such party to Pulsir.</p>
<p>Please be advised that you will be liable for damages if you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is infringing your copyrights. Thus, if you are not sure content located on or linked-to by the Website infringes your copyright, you should consider first contacting an attorney.<br>

Please follow these steps to file a notice:
<br>
Verify that the blog in question is hosted by Pulsir. We only host blogs that have “pulsir.eu”, "pulsir.tk" or "pulsir.me" in their URL or that say “Powered by Pulsir, hosted by Avalon Premium Hosting.” on the site.<br>
Contact the blogger directly. Go to the blog post in question and leave a comment with your complaint to see if the matter can be resolved directly between you and the blogger.<br>
Send your complaint to our support team. If the issue cannot be resolved directly with the blogger, send your complaint to our support team at (we prefer email):<br>

<strong>Pulsir Support</strong>
<p>dev@pulsir.eu</p>
<p>We don't have an adress/P.O. box/phone number/fax number, sorry.</p>

<p>You must include the following:
<br><br>
A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf;
An identification of the copyright claimed to have been infringed;
A description of the nature and exact location of the content that you claim to infringe your copyright, in sufficient detail to permit Pulsir to find and positively identify that content; for example we require a link to the specific blog post (not just the name of the blog) that contains the content and a description of which specific portion of the blog post – an image, a link, the text, etc – your complaint refers to;
Your name, address, telephone number and email address; and
A statement by you: (a) that you believe in good faith that the use of the content that you claim to infringe your copyright is not authorized by law, or by the copyright owner or such owner’s agent; (b) that all of the information contained in your Infringement Notice is accurate, and (c) under penalty of perjury, that you are either the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>If an Infringement Notice is valid, we are required by law to respond to it by disabling access to the allegedly infringing content. If you are a WordPress.com user and access to portions of your blog have been disabled for this reason, we will notify you. You then have the option to send us a written counter-notice (a Counter-Notice) stating why your content does not infringe copyrights and asking for access to be reinstated.</p>

<h3>Notices we got:</h3>
<p>None. I think that's a good thing.</p>
